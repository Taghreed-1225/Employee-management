## API Response Format

All API responses follow this standard format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  }
}
```

## Security

- All passwords are protected using BCrypt hashing
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- Role-based authorization for different resources
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Only ADMIN users can delete employees



By modifying `application.yml` and adding the appropriate driver in `pom.xml`.

## Testing the Application

1. **Start the application**
2. **Login with default accounts:**
   - Admin: `admin/admin123` (full access)
   - User: `user/user123` (limited access)
3. **Use Swagger UI** at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html for interactive testing
4. **Test employee operations** with the pre-loaded sample data

## Frontend Integration

The backend is configured to work with:
- **Angular Frontend** (CORS enabled for http://localhost:4200)
- **React/Vue.js** applications
- **Mobile applications**

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Frontend web application (React/Angular/Vue)
- [ ] Mobile application
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] File upload for employee photos
- [ ] Advanced reporting and analytics
- [ ] Integration with payroll systems
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 8080 already in use**: Change the port in `application.yml`
2. **JWT Token expired**: Login again to get a new token
3. **Access denied**: Make sure you're using the correct role for the operation
4. **Database connection issues**: Check H2 console configuration
